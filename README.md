# lucidity

musings from the great northwest

## todo

- turn scenes into double linked list
- make a decent loading animation
- add about, links, etc

## get started

- install node & npm
- install yarn
- install firebase-tools # the firebase cli
- make a firebase project via the console
- `yarn` # install dependencies
- `yarn dev` # runs webpack, watching for code changes, to build the bundle
- `yarn start` # starts the firebase server, which will serve the latest bundle
- `yarn open`
- refresh whenever you make code changes

## structure

- Firebase lives in `utils/firebase`. Use it for all imports and exports
- state is purely react
- nothing is set in stone

## ps

This is not complete.
